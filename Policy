Privacy Policy

This is the Nivatech Delivery Privacy Policy

This policy explains how Nivatech Market, a service of Nivatech, collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information that we collect through our multi-vendor platform ("the Site", "we" or "us"). Nivatech is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. By using this Site, you agree to these policies.

How the Information is Collected
Information Provided by the User
You provide us with personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and physical address when you register on our platform. Our app may also fetch your location information through Google’s geolocation API and street address API if you have enabled location services on your device. This allows us to enhance your experience by offering location-specific services, such as identifying nearby vendors for product delivery.

Information Provided by Web Browser
We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Site, such as your IP address, device type, browser type, the pages you visit, and the time you spend on those pages. This information helps us understand how you use our Site and enables us to improve our services. This information is generally anonymous and collected on an aggregate basis.

Payment Information
To process your payments for services, we use third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with 3D authentication. We do not store, see, or use your bank card details—payment data is securely processed by these gateways.

Explicit Location Data Disclosure
Our app uses your location data through Google’s geolocation API and street address API to facilitate food delivery services. We use this data to identify your current location for delivery, both when the app is actively in use and, with your consent, in the background to improve the efficiency of our delivery services.

Background Location Data Use: Nivatech Delivery collects location data to enable real-time delivery tracking and ensure accurate delivery even when the app is closed or not in use. This helps us improve delivery accuracy, estimate arrival times, and enhance overall customer experience.

Data Retention: Location data is used during the active session and may be retained temporarily to facilitate delivery tracking. We do not retain this data for long-term use unless it is necessary for delivery logs.

Prominent Disclosure & Consent Requirement
Before accessing your location in the background, we will display a clear in-app disclosure stating:

“Nivatech Delivery collects location data to enable real-time delivery tracking, even when the app is closed or not in use, to help improve delivery accuracy and ensure efficient service.”
This disclosure will be presented in the normal flow of the app, and you will be asked to provide explicit consent before any location data is accessed. You must actively consent by clicking a confirmation button. If you do not consent, the location data will not be collected.

How the Information is Used
Providing and Improving Our Services
We use the information collected to provide and improve our services, process transactions, and enhance the user experience. This includes personalizing content and communications, ensuring site security, and developing new features.

Marketing and Communications
With your explicit consent, we may use your information to send newsletters, special offers, and product updates. You can opt out of these communications at any time.

Data Retention and Deletion Policy
We do not retain user data beyond the necessary time required to complete transactions and fulfill orders. Location data, for example, is used during the session for delivery purposes and is discarded after the order is completed unless retained for delivery logs. Users can request the deletion of their personal information by contacting us directly.

Information Sharing
Third-Party Sellers
We may share your personal information with third-party sellers to process your orders and facilitate deliveries.

Service Providers
We also share information with service providers who assist in operating our platform, such as payment processors, hosting services, and technical support.

Legal Compliance
We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.

Data Security Measures
We use industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information. For payments, we rely on secure third-party gateways (Stripe, PayPal) that use encryption and 3D authentication to process transactions securely. We do not see, store, or manage your payment information.

Your Rights
You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information and withdraw consent for its processing where applicable. You can manage these settings in your account or contact us directly.

Cookies
We use cookies to improve your experience on our Site. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. For more details, refer to our Cookie Policy.

We may update this privacy policy periodically. Significant changes will be communicated through notifications on our Site, and the revision date will be updated accordingly.
